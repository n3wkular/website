It's now been almost a month since I published the long-awaited post about OpenDeck v1.0. To say that I received overwhelming amount of responses would be an understatement. So far, OpenDeck has been featured on [Synthtopia](http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2017/02/01/opendeck-is-an-open-platform-for-making-custom-midi-controllers/), [AskAudio](https://ask.audio/articles/opendeck-makes-it-easy-to-make-your-own-midi-controller-for-any-os), [GearNews](https://www.gearnews.de/shantea-controls-opendeck-midi-controller-diy-fuer-alle-plattformen/), [AudioZine](http://fr.audiofanzine.com/controleur-midi-divers/shantea-controls/opendeck/news/a.play,n.35924.html) and many other places I forgot to mention. A sincere thank you goes to every supporter out there!

The big news here is that I received enough pre-orders for OpenDeck boards. After all payments are done, I'll order a new batch of boards and send them once they arrive. This process should take about a month, hopefully less. Note that boards can still be pre-ordered, but next batch of boards will be ordered a bit later.

I have also opened my own domain (finally!), so web configuration utility can now be found on [shanteacontrols.com](https://shanteacontrols.com). This blog will also move to that domain soon, so that everything is in one place.

This is all for now, stay tuned for more!
